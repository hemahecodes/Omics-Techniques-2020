Title: Amniotic fluid RNA gene expression profiling provides insights into the phenotype of Turner syndrome.

Description: On this study, the fetal amniotic fluid is a complex biological material used to understand the Turner syndrome pathogenesis. Cell-free RNA from amniotic fluid of five mid-trimester Turner syndrome fetuses and five euploid female fetuses was extracted, amplified, and hybridized onto affymetrix arrays. Then, significantly differentially regulated genes were identified to understand which genes are responsible for the phenotypic differences on Turner's syndrome.
